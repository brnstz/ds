## Data Science final project, General Assembly NYC, February-April 2014 ##

### Problem ###

Music recommendation services can be skewed to recommend songs in a similar
genre or time period. Some listeners may want recommendations that span
different genres.

### Hypothesis ###

By analyzing common words in the lyrics of songs, we can find clusters of music that are orthogonal 
to genre, but may still fit the listener's mood or overall musical taste.

### Dataset ###

#### Source ####

The Million Song Dataset and the additional lyric data provided by musicXmatch with word
counts for 270,000 tracks.
